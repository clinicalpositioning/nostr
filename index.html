    <h1>What is Nostr?</h1>
    
    <p>
        Nostr, which stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays", is a simple, open protocol that enables 
        a decentralized, censorship-resistant social network.
    </p>

    <h2>Key features of Nostr:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses public-key cryptography to sign and verify messages, ensuring authenticity</li>
        <li>Relies on a network of relays to transmit messages, rather than a centralized server</li>
        <li>Gives users control over their data and identity</li>
        <li>Highly scalable and resistant to censorship</li>
        <li>Can be used to build various apps, from social media to Bitcoin exchanges</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        With Nostr, users run a client locally and publish signed messages to relays. Subscribers to those relays are 
        then notified of the messages. Users can connect to multiple relays for greater reach.
    </p>

    <p>
        The protocol aims to solve issues like censorship and lack of user control that are common on mainstream social 
        media platforms. Nostr is a distinct protocol from cryptocurrencies and blockchains, focusing purely on data 
        transmission and communication.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Nostr?</h2>
    <p>
        Nostr leverages a simple, decentralized architecture to enable an open, resilient social network 
        protocol that anyone can build on and no single entity can control or censor. It's an exciting development in 
        the push for a more open internet.
